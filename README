Publish and Consume Library
Copyright (C) 2007  Openismus GmbH

ABSTRACT
========

The Easy Publish and Consume library provides an easy method to:

    * publish data per HTTPS
    * announce that information via DNS-SD
    * find that information
    * and finally consume it

You can use this library as key/value store published to the network,
using encryption, authentication and service discovery.

REQUIREMENTS
============

The libepc library depends on:

    * avahi-client >= 0.6
    * avahi-glib   >= 0.6
    * glib         >= 2.12
    * gmodule-2.0  >= 2.0
    * gobject      >= 2.4
    * gnutls       >= 1.6
    * libsoup      >= 2.2
    * libuuid      >= 0.36 [1]

Additionally libepc-ui uses:

    * gtk+         >= 2.10

And finally the examples need:

    * avahi-ui     >= 0.6


  [1] NOTICE: Currently Debian, Ubuntu and derivates have the development
      files of libuuid in the "uuid-dev" package instead of "libuuid-dev",
      which would be the expected package name (IMHO). Well, but surprisingly
      there are no naming conventions for development packages, as I was told
      on #debian-devel.
